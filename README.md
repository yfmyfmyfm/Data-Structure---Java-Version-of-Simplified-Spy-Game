# Data-Structure---Java-Version-of-Simplified-Spy-Game

The goals of this project are to:

    Understand and implement the Graph components: an undirected weighted graph.
    Understand and implement BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra's Shortest path graph traversal methods.
    Complete implemenation of an interesting game that can be configured in a variety of ways.

Description

    You belong to UWPD and you are going to catch the spy moving across our city. If he/she is not caught within a particular time frame (a number of steps-moves), he/she will destroy Madison!
    The spy moves randomly in the city and you move around searching for him. You can also use a limited number of your spycams to catch the spy, since you cannot be everywhere! You win when you catch or surround him before the time expires. If not, the Spy wins.
    You will be implementing an interactive game that will allow the player to take various actions by typing a command. If the player lands on the same location as the spy or successfully surrounds the spy before the number of steps is reached, the city is saved.
